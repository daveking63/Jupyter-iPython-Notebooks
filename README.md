# Jupyter_iPython_Notebooks
Collection of Notebooks containing notes/tutorial on various Python programs

This repository contains a series of Jupyter/iPython notebooks illustrating the use of select Python modules or libraries dealing with various problems in data science.  The current list of topics includes:

<ul>
<li><b>NumPy</b>: Part of the larger SciPy library, provides a number of methods and functions for creating, managing and manipulating N-dimensional numpy arrays which includes an extensive collection of mathematical and statistical methods for operating on those arrays.</li>
<li><b>Pandas</b>: Also part of the SciPy libraries, it is a Python package aimed at helping data scientists with: "munging and cleaning data, analyzing/modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display.>/li>
<li><b>NetworkX</b>: A Python package "for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks (aka graphs)." While it can be used to understand the operation of virtually any type of network, here the primary focus is on social network analysis (SNA).
<li><b>Dictionaries, JSON, and PyMongo</b>: While data science is typically focused on tabular and relational data, much of the data in the world of the web is non-relational in nature. One of the key, non-relational alternatives is the "document-oriented" format found in Python dictionaries, JSON objects, and databases like Mongo designed to handle "semi-structured representations for nested data." This notebook focuses on these formats.
</ul>
