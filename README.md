# Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks
Collection of Notebooks containing notes/tutorials for various Python libraries (in process)

This repository contains a series of Jupyter/iPython notebooks illustrating the use of select Python modules or libraries dealing with various problems in data science.  The current list of topics includes:

<ul>
<li><b>NumPy</b>: Part of the larger SciPy library, provides a number of methods and functions for creating, managing and manipulating N-dimensional numpy arrays which includes an extensive collection of mathematical and statistical methods for operating on those arrays.</li>
<li><b>Pandas</b>: Also part of the SciPy libraries, it is a Python package aimed at helping data scientists with: "munging and cleaning data, analyzing/modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display.</li>
<li><b>Working with Semi-Structured Data: Python Dictionaries, JSON, MongoDB and PyMongo</b>: While data science is typically focused on tabular and relational data, much of the data in the world of the web is non-relational in nature. One of the key, non-relational alternatives is the "document-oriented" format found in Python dictionaries, JSON objects, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB designed to handle "semi-structured" representations for nested data, and a Python Library called PyMongo for accessing MongoDB's capabilities." This notebook focuses on these formats.</li></li>
<li><b>NetworkX</b>: A Python package "for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks (aka graphs)." While it can be used to understand the operation of virtually any type of network, here the primary focus is on social network analysis (SNA). [Note: this notebook is in process]</li></li>

In a github repository, <i>.ipynb</i> notebooks are rendered as static files. There are a variety of ways to access the interactive features of a notebook in a repository. One way is to set up a local notebook server (e.g. on your laptop) and download the notebook of interest to this server. Another is to use <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org">Jupyter's web-based <i>nbviewer</i></a> to render the notebook. This is done by simply entering the url of the .ipynb notebook of interest on the site. For example, the following url would activate the NumPy notebook in this repository:
